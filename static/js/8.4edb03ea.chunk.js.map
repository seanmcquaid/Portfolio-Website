After I moved to Atlanta, I\n          quickly realized that I wanted a day job that would allow me to\n          utilize my creative problem solving skills from music.\n        </P>\n        <P id=\"bioParagraphTwo\" data-testid=\"bioParagraphTwo\">\n          I accidentally discovered programming one night while scrolling on\n          Facebook and seeing that a musician friend of mine from high school\n          recently landed a job at Google. Upon investigating more and seeing\n          that his job title was a Software Engineer, I quickly came to\n          understand why he decided to pursue programming. That night was when I\n          wrote my first lines of HTML/CSS and I have loved it ever since! After\n          six months of self studying, I decided to enroll in DigitalCrafts, a\n          coding bootcamp based in Atlanta. Shortly after graduating, I was\n          lucky enough to land my first Software Engineering role at Chick-fil-A\n          where I worked on various parts of the CFAOne App. I am currently\n          serving as a React developer on our Personal Web Ordering project\n          which is being used as our online ordering platform for both domestic\n          and international restaurants!\n        </P>\n        <P id=\"bioParagraphThree\" data-testid=\"bioParagraphThree\">\n          It's very important to me that I continue to grow my skills and learn\n          different specializations within Software Engineering so I can be a\n          well informed engineer. My ultimate career goal is to be a Software\n          Architect and make enterprise wide technical decisions that will help\n          everyone in the company. I truly believe that having a wider\n          perspective will inevitably lead to me making better decisions for the\n          organization that I have the privelege to serve.\n        </P>\n      </Article>\n    </Main>\n  </AboutPageContainer>\n);\n\nconst fadeInAnimation = keyframes`\n    0% { \n        opacity: 0; \n    } \n    100% { \n        opacity: 1; \n    } \n`;\n\nconst AboutPageContainer = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  width: 100%;\n  transition: 0.5s;\n  animation: ${fadeInAnimation} ease 1s;\n  animation-iteration-count: 1;\n  animation-fill-mode: forwards;\n  @media (max-width: 975px) {\n    justify-content: flex-start;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Header = styled.header`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  padding: 0.5rem;\n`;\n\nconst Main = styled.main`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: row;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  @media (max-width: 975px) {\n    flex-direction: column;\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Article = styled.article`\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n  max-width: 36rem;\n`;\n\nexport default About;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
