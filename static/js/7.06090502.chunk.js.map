Upon investigating more and seeing\n          that his job title was a Software Engineer, I quickly came to\n          understand why he decided to pursue programming.

Shortly after graduating, I was\n          lucky enough to land my current role at Chick-fil-A where I have\n          worked on various parts of the CFAOne App team.\n        </P>\n        <P id=\"bioParagraphThree\" data-testid=\"bioParagraphThree\">\n          My ultimate career goal is to be a Software Architect and make\n          enterprise wide technical decisions that will help everyone in the\n          company.
