That night was when I wrote my first lines of HTML/CSS and I have loved it ever since! After six months of self studying, I decided to enroll in DigitalCrafts, a coding bootcamp based in Atlanta. Shortly after graduating, I was lucky enough to land my first Software Engineering role at Chick-fil-A where I worked on various parts of the CFAOne App. I am currently serving as a React developer on our Personal Web Ordering project which is being used as our online ordering platform for both domestic and international restaurants!"),c.a.createElement(m.g,{id:"bioParagraphThree","data-testid":"bioParagraphThree"},"It's very important to me that I continue to grow my skills and learn different specializations within Software Engineering so I can be a well informed engineer.
