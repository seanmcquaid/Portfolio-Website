My professional background is in music and now, Software\n            Engineering. I have been playing the trumpet for over 20 years and\n            have a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Music. After I moved to\n            Atlanta, I quickly realized that I wanted a day job that would allow\n            me to utilize my creative problem solving skills from music.\n          </ParagraphText>\n          <ParagraphText id=\"bioParagraphTwo\" data-testid=\"bioParagraphTwo\">\n            I accidentally discovered programming one night while scrolling on\n            Facebook and seeing that a musician friend of mine from high school\n            recently landed a job at Google. Upon investigating more and seeing\n            that his job title was a Software Engineer, I quickly came to\n            understand why he decided to pursue programming. That night was when\n            I wrote my first lines of HTML/CSS and I have loved it ever since!\n            After six months of self studying, I decided to enroll in\n            DigitalCrafts, a coding bootcamp based in Atlanta. Shortly after\n            graduating, I was lucky enough to land my current role at\n            Chick-fil-A and I am LOVING IT!\n          </ParagraphText>\n          <ParagraphText id=\"bioParagraphThree\" data-testid=\"bioParagraphThree\">\n            My ultimate career goal is to be a Software Architect and make\n            enterprise wide technical decisions that will help everyone in the\n            company. However, I would like to transition to different areas of\n            development along the way to become a more well versed and informed\n            Software Engineer.
