# Portfolio Website

This is meant to serve as my new portfolio website built in React. I felt it was time to update my old portfolio website so I thought it'd be a good chance to build something in React and improve the design of my portfolio website!

## Things Learned

#### Unit Testing with React Testing Library

At work, I primarily have used the standard Jest/Enzyme package for unit testing. This time around, I decided to try the newer and lighter weight React Testing Library. It was definitely an interesitng experience and I learned about both the advantages/disadvantages of utilizing React Testing Library. I encountered some problems writing proper unit tests for resetting window width properly so I will most likely circle back to this later when I've learned of an actual working solution for this.

#### CI/CD - GitHub Actions

I decided to utilize the hip new CI/CD platform, GitHub Actions. I primarily utilize Jenkins at work so I wanted to try a totally different testing tool that has a bit better user experience. It took me less than 2 hours to get a working pipeline in place and I have been thrilled with the experience thus far. I look forward to using this exclusively for my personal projects from now on!
